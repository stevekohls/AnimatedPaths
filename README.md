AnimatedPaths
=============

This is a fork of xjones' repo for demomstrating an animation bug in iOS 7. I saw the same bug, but was using a CABasicAnimation and 
CAKeyframeAnimation, instead of two CAKeyframeAnimations, like xjones.

For reference, see this question on Stack Overflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19259076/how-to-synchronize-animations-of-2-different-layers
